ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few personal projects, including app development, Arduino-based robotics, and tools that solve real-world problems.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Python, JavaScript (React & Node), and diving deeper into AI and machine learning.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects, hackathons, or anything creative and impactful in tech.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with scaling mobile apps and contributing to larger developer communities.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coding, robotics, app development, or how I balance projects!
